Description of Idea:

Game name: Game of luck
Idea: Endless Fun
Intention: Killing boredom

Games are meant to be played and this is a one which will keep you entertained anytime and antwhere you want.
There are no age restrictions for the game. Any age group from small children to adults can enjoy the game.
The basic idea behind this is to basically try your luck and see if you are lucky enough to win this game.

Working: Firstly when you visit the webpage,you will see an attaractive homepage where user have to input their name and hit the start button and proceed.
It is here where the real game begins. Now you need to enter a number between 0 to 100. You will get 5 chances to enter your number.
If the number matches with the one that is randomly picked by the computer,you win. If your number doesn't match,keep trying again until you have chances left and
the good thing is that an alert box will also provide you with a hint whether you need to put a number larger than or smaller than the number you have inputed previously. 
If you are not lucky to get win for the first time,don't feel bad,just try again.
